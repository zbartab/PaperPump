Dear Editor,

Please see attached my manuscript entitled "Publication games: in the web of reciprocity", and submitted as an original research article to PLOS ONE.

Under recent research assessment protocols questionable authorship practices seem to flower. An especially problematic one is when a group of authors form a publication cartel where each of them reciprocally gifts honorary authorship to others in the cartel. In this paper I present a simple model to show that members of publication cartels are always better off than researchers not cartelling even if the 1/n rule (publications are weighted by the inverse of their number of authors) is used to assess their productivity. With a more realistic simulation, on the other hand, I found that the use of the 1/n rule can generate conflicts of interest among cartel members and between members and non-members which might lead to the self-purification of the academic publishing industry.

I confirm that this manuscript has not been previously published and is currently not under consideration by any other journal. The manuscript is the result of my own work.

I suggest the following Academic Editors with expertise in this field:

1. Diego Raphael Amancio, orcid.org/0000-0002-3422-5166, University of Sao Paulo, BRAZIL 
2. Nguyen Tien Huy, orcid.org/0000-0002-9543-9440, Nagasaki University: Nagasaki Daigaku, JAPAN 
3. Alberto Baccini, orcid.org/0000-0003-0293-482X, University of Siena, ITALY 

I don't have any opposed reviewers.

Sincerely yours,
