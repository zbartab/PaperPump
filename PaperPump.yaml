    In academia, manuscripts serve as an important component of career
    development. The past several years have seen heightened evaluation of the
    role of the gender gap in career advancement, as well as other bibliometric
    changes in publications. We therefore analyzed authorship and publication
    trends in the Annals of Biomedical Engineering over the past three decades
    (one complete year of manuscripts for each decade; 1986, 1996, 2006, and
    2016). The variables analyzed were number of authors per manuscript,
    numerical position of the corresponding author, number of collaborating
    institutions and countries, number of references, and number of citations
    per manuscript. The gender of both the first and corresponding authors was
    identified and analyzed over time and by region. Globally, the percentage of
    female first and corresponding authors significantly increased from 0% in
    1986 to 28.6% (p = 0.003) and 20.4% (p = 0.0009), respectively, in 2016.
    Although there were significant differences regarding female first and
    corresponding author over time, they did not vary by region of origin
    (p = 0.5 and 0.2, respectively). Overall, these findings highlight the
    improvements made and the challenges that still exist related to publishing
    within the bioengineering field.

    Authorship is the currency of an academic career. Scientific publications
    have significant academic and financial implications. Several standard
    authorship guidelines exist, and the International Committee of Medical
    Journal Editors (ICMJE) is the most popular amongst them. There are
    increasing concerns about the ethics of publications with the rise of
    inappropriate authorship. The most important reason appears to be a lack of
    knowledge and awareness of the authorship guidelines and what actions
    constitute unethical behaviors. There is a need to incorporate standard
    guidelines in medical curricula and conduct structured training and
    education programs for researchers across the board. The current perspective
    describes the significant concepts of appropriate and inappropriate
    authorship, and the possible measures being formulated to shape the future
    of authorship.

    Research assessments have been under growing scrutiny in the past few years.
    The way in which researchers are assessed has a tangible impact on decisions
    and practices in research. Yet, there is an emerging understanding that
    research assessments as they currently stand might hamper the quality and
    the integrity of research. In this chapter, we provide a narrative review of
    the shortcomings of current research assessments and showcase innovative
    actions that aim to address these. To discuss these shortcomings and
    actions, we target five diﬀerent dimensions of research assessment. First,
    we discuss the content of research assessment, thereby introducing the
    common indicators used to assess researchers and the way these indicators
    are being used. Second, we address the procedure of research assessments,
    describing the resources needed for assessing researchers in an ever-growing
    research system. Third, we describe the crucial role of assessors in
    improving research assessments. Fourth, we present the broader environments
    in which researchers work, explaining that omnipresent competition and
    employment insecurity also need to be toned down substantially to foster
    high quality and high integrity research. Finally, we describe the challenge
    of coordinating individual actions to ensure that the problems of research
    assessments are addressed tangibly and sustainably.

    There is anecdotal information available that some reviewers attempt to
    increase their citation counts by using the peer review process, adding
    references to reviewed publications. There have been studies around citation
    coercion from the perspective of journal editing and boosting of journal
    indicators. This study builds further on that work, with a different angle:
    by measuring excessive citation manipulation at the level of reviewers. In
    order to assess the extent of this behaviour, access to a large pool of
    peer-review records is required: connections between authors and reviewers,
    connections between reviewers and reviewed work and so forth. This study
    explores this area in two phases. In phase one we detect the overall
    patterns of citations from reviewed material to reviewers, and assign a
    value to the proportion of citations originating from reviewed work. The
    second phase further explores the citation patterns, by taking the outliers
    from phase one and identifying the citations that have been added during the
    review process. We find in the results that highly suspicious cases of this
    behaviour can be successfully detected and that the scale of suspicion of
    clear misconduct behaviour is relatively limited (0.79%).

    Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise
    from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to
    create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy
    and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by
    practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic
    programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then
    rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts
    of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best
    left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce
    the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between
    specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment.
    Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right
    algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good
    computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after
    differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as
    code through another technique from computer science, generic programming.
    Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing
    human convenience.

    Research integrity is under threat. Apart from traditional research
    malpractices that include fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism, recent
    reports reflect intentionally biased citations and other complex
    malpractices to inflate impact factors mutually (excessive self-cites,
    citation stacking, cartels, cabals, and rings). Such journals are
    blacklisted annually by Thomson Reuters firm since 2009. This paper
    highlights and categorizes all possible cases of research misconduct. It
    creates awareness and an urgent need to introduce new monitoring and
    evaluation standards based on advanced computational intelligence
    techniques. Further, existing metrics need to be redefined, traditionally
    based upon citation and publication count as key quantifiers.

    Research is a highly competitive profession where evaluation plays a central
    role; journals are ranked and individuals are evaluated based on their
    publication number, the number of times they are cited and their h-index.
    Yet such evaluations are often done in inappropriate ways that are damaging
    to individual careers, particularly for young scholars, and to the
    profession. Furthermore, as with all indices, people can play games to
    better their scores. This has resulted in the incentive structure of science
    increasingly mimicking economic principles, but rather than a monetary gain,
    the incentive is a higher score. To ensure a diversity of cultural
    perspectives and individual experiences, we gathered a team of academics in
    the fields of ecology and evolution from around the world and at different
    career stages. We first examine how authorship, h-index of individuals and
    journal impact factors are being used and abused. Second, we speculate on
    the consequences of the continued use of these metrics with the hope of
    sparking discussions that will help our fields move in a positive direction.
    We would like to see changes in the incentive systems, rewarding quality
    research and guaranteeing transparency. Senior faculty should establish the
    ethical standards, mentoring practices and institutional evaluation criteria
    to create the needed changes.

    Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and
    have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made
    phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws
    is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the
    distribution – the part of the distribution representing large but rare
    events – and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law
    behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as
    least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of
    parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods
    return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no
    indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a
    principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law
    behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting
    methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
    and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with
    tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous
    approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world
    data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been
    conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these
    conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is
    ruled out.

    The point I wish to make is not what we all know: that the methods to assess
    the quality of research achievement are controversial. I do not wish to call
    into question the raison d’être of scientometric approach, its methodology
    or its particular indicators either. Nor am I aiming at coming up with
    systematic solutions of the contradictions (although I hope to offer some
    thoughts in that direction later below). Many have called and keep calling
    attention to the rigid and uniform application of the numerical approach
    (counting publications), arguing that it is doing injustice to certain areas
    of science.1 With that as a starting point, this study is intended to serve
    two purposes. One, in a much sharper tone than generally used in discussions
    of the topic, I wish to call attention to how extremely harmful the present
    scientometric practice may be for many scholars and scientists. Two, also
    partly in support of the former argument, I propose to demonstrate—to the
    degree of breadth and depth that the sizeconstraints of this paper make
    possible—how the crucial contradiction in question at the core of the
    present practice follows from the myths generated by scientometry itself.

    Universities looking to recruit or to rank researchers have to attribute
    credit scores to their academic publications. While they could use indexes,
    there remains the difficulty of coauthored papers. It is unfair to count an
    n-authored paper as one paper for each coauthor, i.e., as n papers added to
    the total: this is “feeding the multitude” . Sharing the credit among
    coauthors by percentages or by simply dividing by n (“1/n rule”) is fairer
    but somewhat harsh. Accordingly, we propose to take into account the
    productivity gains of parallelization by introducing a parallelization bonus
    that multiplies the credit allocated to each coauthor. It might be an idea
    for coauthors to indicate how they organized their work in producing the
    paper. However, they might systematically bias their answers. Fortunately,
    the number of parallel tasks is bounded by the number of coauthors because
    of specialization and the credit is bounded by a limiting Pareto maximum.
    Thus, the credit is given by (N+2)/3n for N parallel tasks. As there may be,
    at most, as many parallel tasks as co-authors, credit allocated to each
    coauthor is given by (n+2)/3n, that varies between 2/3 of a single-authored
    paper for two coauthors and 1/3 when the number of coauthors is very large.
    This is the “maximum parallelization credit” rule that we propose to apply.
    This new approach is feasible. It can be applied to past and present papers
    regardless of the agreement of publishing houses. It is fair and it rewards
    genuine cooperation in academic publishing.

    Researchers in Europe are increasingly assessed by their publication

    strategies of clinical researchers in Denmark, we interviewed 9 senior
    researchers at the Department of Clinical Research at the University of
    Southern Denmark with the lowest and highest values for a, as defined by
    Hirsch. Our aim is to investigate the importance of these metrics to their
    academic careers: h-index, number of publications, number of citations,
    international collaborations, local collaborations, field specific journal
    publishing and high journal impact factor publishing. To validate our
    findings we compared their publication record to their statistically
    analyzed stated publication strategy. Our results indicate two styles of
    publication strategy used by these senior researchers. Researchers with Low
    a engage in local collaborations, disseminate knowledge in local media and
    publish in field specific journals, while researchers with High a engage in
    international collaborations, invest significant time in publishing in the
    highest impact journals in their field, and acquire a greater number of
    citations. Both publication strategies can lead to a successful academic
    career, yet we have an indication through the h5-index that the practices of
    the High a group are more likely to nudge the h-index.

    Over the last 50 years, we argue that incentives for academic scientists
    have become increasingly perverse in terms of competition for research
    funding, development of quantitative metrics to measure performance, and a
    changing business model for higher education itself. Furthermore, decreased
    discretionary funding at the federal and state level is creating a
    hypercompetitive environment between government agencies (e.g., EPA, NIH,
    CDC), for scientists in these agencies, and for academics seeking funding
    from all sources-the combination of perverse incentives and decreased
    funding increases pressures that can lead to unethical behavior. If a
    critical mass of scientists become untrustworthy, a tipping point is
    possible in which the scientific enterprise itself becomes inherently
    corrupt and public trust is lost, risking a new dark age with devastating
    consequences to humanity. Academia and federal agencies should better
    support science as a public good, and incentivize altruistic and ethical
    outcomes, while de-emphasizing output.

    Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs are useful for organizing
    classifiers and visualizing their performance. ROC graphs are commonly used
    in medical decision making, and in recent years have been used increasingly
    in machine learning and data mining research. Although ROC graphs are
    apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when
    using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an
    introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research.

    Some scholars add authors to their research papers or grant proposals even
    when those individuals contribute nothing to the research effort. Some
    journal editors coerce authors to add citations that are not pertinent to
    their work and some authors pad their reference lists with superfluous
    citations. How prevalent are these types of manipulation, why do scholars
    stoop to such practices, and who among us is most susceptible to such
    ethical lapses? This study builds a framework around how intense competition
    for limited journal space and research funding can encourage manipulation
    and then uses that framework to develop hypotheses about who manipulates and
    why they do so. We test those hypotheses using data from over 12,000
    responses to a series of surveys sent to more than 110,000 scholars from
    eighteen different disciplines spread across science, engineering, social
    science, business, and health care. We find widespread misattribution in
    publications and in research proposals with significant variation by
    academic rank, discipline, sex, publication history, co-authors, etc. Even
    though the majority of scholars disapprove of such tactics, many feel
    pressured to make such additions while others suggest that it is just the
    way the game is played. The findings suggest that certain changes in the
    review process might help to stem this ethical decline, but progress could
    be slow.

    In a survey on research misconduct, roughly 20% of the respondents admitted
    that they have submitted federal grant proposals that include scholars as
    research participants even though those scholars were not expected to
    contribute to the research effort. This manuscript argues that adding such
    false investigators is illegal, violating multiple federal statutes
    including the False Statements Act (18 U.S.C. §1001), the False Claims Act
    (31 U.S.C. §3729), and False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Claims (18 U.S.C.
    §287). Moreover, it is not only the offending academics and the false
    investigators that face civil and criminal penalties because administrators
    may also be liable if they sign off on proposals and are in a position to
    know that false investigators might be included. Policy recommendations that
    should reduce the use of false investigators include changing institutional
    cultures, better training and oversight of the responsible conduct of
    research, and, most importantly, making all grant reviews double blind.

    Background

    Prevalence of research misconduct, questionable research practices (QRPs)
    and their associations with a range of explanatory factors has not been
    studied sufficiently among academic researchers.

    Methods 

    The National Survey on Research Integrity was aimed at all disciplinary
    fields and academic ranks in the Netherlands. The survey enquired about
    engagement in fabrication, falsification and 11 QRPs over the previous three
    years, and 12 explanatory factor scales. We ensured strict identity
    protection and used a randomized response method for questions on research
    misconduct. 

    Results

    6,813 respondents completed the survey. Prevalence of fabrication was 4.3%
    (95% CI: 2.9, 5.7) and falsification 4.2% (95% CI: 2.8, 5.6). Prevalence of
    QRPs ranged from 0.6% (95% CI: 0.5, 0.9) to 17.5% (95 % CI: 16.4, 18.7) with
    51.3% (95% CI: 50.1, 52.5) of respondents engaging frequently in ≥ 1 QRP.
    Being a PhD candidate or junior researcher increased the odds of frequently
    engaging in ≥ 1 QRP, as did being male. Scientific norm subscription (odds
    ratio (OR) 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00) and perceived likelihood of detection
    by reviewers (OR 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88) were associated with lower odds
    of research misconduct. Publication pressure was associated with higher odds
    of engaging frequently in  ≥ 1 QRP (OR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.30).

    Conclusions

    We found higher prevalence of misconduct than earlier surveys. Our results
    suggest that greater emphasis on scientific norm subscription, strengthening
    reviewers in their role as gatekeepers of research quality and curbing the
    “publish or perish” incentive system can promote research integrity.

    Background

    While substantial attention has been paid to research misbehaviors,
    responsible research practices (RRPs) and their potential explanatory
    factors have not been studied extensively.

    Methods 

    The National Survey on Research Integrity (NSRI) is an online survey
    targeting all disciplines and academic ranks in The Netherlands. Data was
    collected on 11 RRPs and 12 explanatory factor scales. Results were
    controlled for explanatory factor scales, academic rank, disciplinary field,
    gender, doing empirical research and if respondents belonged to a NSRI
    supporting institution or not.

    Results

    6,813 respondents completed the survey. The RRPs with the highest prevalence
    were avoiding plagiarism (99%), disclosing conflicts of interest (96.5%) and
    checking for errors before publication (94.3%). Preregistration of study
    protocols (42.8%), making accessible underlying data and syntaxes (47.2%),
    and keeping comprehensive research records (56.3%) had the lowest
    prevalence. Arts and humanities scholars, PhD candidates and junior
    researchers were associated with a lower RRP mean (-0.51 and -0.31
    respectively) as was publication pressure (-0.05; 95% CI -0.08, -0.02).
    Mentoring (0.15; 95% CI 0.12, 0.17), scientific norm subscription (0.13; 95%
    CI 0.1, 0.15) and funding pressure (0.13; 95% CI0.10, 0.17) were
    significantly associated with a higher RRP mean.

    Conclusions

    We found publication pressure to affect RRPs negatively. Mentoring,
    scientific norm subscription and funding pressure may help foster RRPs. Arts
    and humanities scholars, PhD candidates and junior researchers need more
    efforts to raise awareness on RRPs. Further research on these groups is
    warranted in order to understand research integrity challenges that may be
    unique to them.

    Academics are becoming accustomed to growing demands on ‘performance’ as
    universities place increasing emphasis on quantifiable research outputs.
    Despite the rapid ascendancy of bibliometrics, limited empirical research
    has considered the definitions of “research performance” employed by
    institutions, and subsequent academic responses. Drawing on exploratory data
    collected from 58 university-based colleagues in 23 countries, supplemented
    with the personal experiences of authors, this manuscript explores how
    institutions utilise bibliometrics, and how scholars adapt. Findings
    demonstrate a significant number of mechanisms utilised by institutions to
    assess research performance, postulating the emergence of forms of ‘academic
    entrepreneurship’, characterised by more and less ethical patterns of
    manipulation. A conceptual model of bibliometric engagement is presented,
    with implications for tourism and cognate disciplines.

    Decisiones sobre autoría en ecología, evolución, biología de organismos y
    gestión de recursos naturales; quién, cómo y por qué La publicación en
    revistas con revisión crítica es fundamental para  lograr progresos
    científicos como: 1) la mejora del conocimiento, 2)  beneficios sociales
    como la toma de decisiones basada en datos  científicos, 3) la evaluación de
    la productividad de los investigadores,  y 4) la obtención y el
    mantenimiento de un puesto de docente  universitario, y la facilitación de
    futuras contribuciones científicas. A  medida que la ciencia se vuelve más
    compleja, también lo hacen los  resultados necesarios para la publicación,
    que frecuentemente requieren  la colaboración de científicos de distintos
    campos. No obstante, la  publicación colaborativa siempre incluye la
    posibilidad de que se  produzcan malentendidos y diferentes opiniones. En
    este estudio, primero  examinamos los artículos publicados sobre la
    determinación de la  autoría de publicaciones científicas en materia de
    ecología, evolución,  biología de los organismos y gestión de recursos
    naturales, y luego se  estudió en qué consiste la autoría y se analizaron
    las contribuciones  del autor, el orden de los autores en la línea de firma
    y las relaciones  de poder, tras lo cual proporcionamos varios ejemplos de
    situaciones  realistas de conflictos de autoría con fines pedagógicos y para
    entablar  un debate con compañeros y estudiantes.

    The aim of this paper is to propose a new quantitative metric that can be
    used to measure the total actual researcher contribution (ARC) to a body of
    knowledge. The proposed ARC metric is a fair measure that is needed to
    address the abuse of research collaboration and issues arising from honorary
    authorship, which both lead to the inflation of the total number of
    published articles by a researcher. This inflation can provide misleading
    information about a researcher’s expertise and competence based on their
    perceived contribution. Research ranking agencies, database indexes,
    universities, and other decision makers can rely on the ARC metric to rank
    and evaluate university and researcher contributions to a body of knowledge
    and thus make more informed decisions and allocate research resources more
    efficiently.

    Modern scientific research has become largely a cooperative activity in the
    Internet age. We build a simulation model to understand the population-level
    creativity based on the heuristic ant colony algorithm. Each researcher has
    two heuristic parameters characterizing the goodness of his own judgments
    and his trust on literature. In a population with all kinds of researchers,
    we find that as the problem scale increases, the contributor distribution
    significantly shifts from the independent regime of relying on one's own
    judgments to the cooperative regime of more closely following the
    literature. The distribution also changes with the stage of the research
    problem and the computing power available. Our work provides some
    preliminary understanding and guidance for the dynamical process of
    cooperative scientific research in various disciplines.

    The article at hand presents the results of a literature review on the
    ethical issues related to scientific authorship. These issues are understood
    as questions and/or concerns about obligations, values or virtues in
    relation to reporting, authorship and publication of research results. For
    this purpose, the Web of Science core collection was searched for English
    resources published between 1945 and 2018, and a total of 324 items were
    analyzed. Based on the review of the documents, ten ethical themes have been
    identified, some of which entail several ethical issues. Ranked on the basis
    of their frequency of occurrence these themes are: 1) attribution, 2)
    violations of the norms of authorship, 3) bias, 4) responsibility and
    accountability, 5) authorship order, 6) citations and referencing, 7)
    definition of authorship, 8) publication strategy, 9) originality, and 10)
    sanctions. In mapping these themes, the current article explores major
    ethical issue and provides a critical discussion about the application of
    codes of conduct, various understandings of culture, and contributing
    factors to unethical behavior.

    The practice of assigning authorship for a scientific publication tends to
    raise two normative questions: 1) “who should be credited as an author?”; 2)
    “who should not be credited as an author but should still be acknowledged?”.
    With the publication of the revised version of The European Code of Conduct
    for Research Integrity (ECCRI), standard answers to these questions have
    been called into question. This article examines the ways in which the ECCRI
    approaches these two questions and compares these approaches to standard
    definitions of “authorship” and “acknowledgment” in guidelines issued by the
    International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) and the World
    Association of Medical Editors (WAME). In light of two scenarios and the
    problems posed by these kinds of “real-world” examples, we recommend
    specific revisions to the content of the ECCRI in order not only to provide
    a more detailed account of the tasks deserving of acknowledgment, but to
    improve the Code’s current definition of authorship.

    Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research
    findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend
    on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question,
    and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the
    relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research
    finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are
    smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and
    lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater
    flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when
    there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more
    teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical
    significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it
    is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for
    many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be
    simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss
    the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of
    research.

    Scientific authorship has become a contested terrain in contemporary
    science. Based on a survey of authors across fields, we measure the
    likelihood of specialist authors (sometimes called “guest” authors): people
    who only made specialized contributions, such as data, materials, or
    funding; and “nonauthor collaborators” (sometimes referred to as “ghost”
    authors): those who did significant work on the project but do not appear as
    authors, across different research contexts, including field, size of the
    project team, commercial orientation, impact of publication, and
    organization of the collaboration. We find that guest and ghost authors are
    common, with about one-third of publications having at least one specialist
    author and over half having at least one nonauthor collaborator. We see
    significant cross-field variations in both overall rates and types of
    specialist authors and nonauthor collaborators. We find there are generally
    fewer specialist authors among highly cited papers and more graduate student
    nonauthor collaborators in single location projects. The results suggest
    authorship practices vary across fields, and by project characteristics,
    complicating the use of authorship lists as a basis for evaluation
    (especially when comparing across fields or types of projects). We discuss
    implications of these findings for interpreting author lists in the context
    of science policy.

    Author name ambiguity in a digital library may affect the ﬁndings of
    research that mines authorship data of the library. This study evaluates
    author name disambiguation in DBLP, a widely used but insufﬁciently
    evaluated digital library for its disambiguation performance. In doing so,
    this study takes a triangulation approach that author name disambiguation
    for a digital library can be better evaluated when its performance is
    assessed on multiple labeled datasets with comparison to baselines. Tested
    on three types of labeled data containing 5000 to 6 M disambiguated names,
    DBLP is shown to assign author names quite accurately to distinct authors,
    resulting in pairwise precision, recall, and F1 measures around 0.90 or
    above overall. DBLP’s author name disambiguation performs well even on large
    ambiguous name blocks but deﬁciently on distinguishing authors with the same
    names. Compared to other disambiguation algorithms, DBLP’s disambiguation
    performance is quite competitive, possibly due to its hybrid disambiguation
    approach combining algorithmic disambiguation and manual error correction. A
    discussion follows on strengths and weaknesses of labeled datasets used in
    this study for future efforts to evaluate author name disambiguation on a
    digital library scale.

    In the fast-growing scholarly big data background, social network
    technologies have recently aroused widespread attention in academia and
    industry. The concept of academic social networks is created precisely in
    the context of scholarly big data, which refers to the complicated academic
    network formed by academic entities and their relationships. There are a
    wealth of scholarly big data processing methods to analyze the rich
    structural types and related information about academic social networks.
    Nowadays, various academic data can be easily obtained, which makes it
    easier for us to analyze and study academic social networks. This study
    investigates the background, the current status, and trends of academic
    social networks. We first elaborate on the concept of academic social
    networks and related research background. Secondly, we analyze models based
    on nodes' types and timeliness. Thirdly, we review analytical methods,
    including relevant metrics, network properties, and available academic
    analysis tools. Furthermore, we sort out some key mining technologies for
    academic social networks. Finally, we systematically review representative
    research tasks in this domain from three levels: actor, relationship, and
    network. In addition, some academic social networking sites are presented.
    This survey concludes with the current challenges and open issues.

    Sensitivity and specificity are two components that measure the inherent
    validity of a diagnostic test for dichotomous outcomes against a gold
    standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is the plot that
    depicts the trade-off between the sensitivity and (1-specificity) across a
    series of cut-off points when the diagnostic test is continuous or on
    ordinal scale (minimum 5 categories). This is an effective method for
    assessing the performance of a diagnostic test. The aim of this article is
    to provide basic conceptual framework and interpretation of ROC analysis to
    help medical researchers to use it effectively. ROC curve and its important
    components like area under the curve, sensitivity at specified specificity
    and vice versa, and partial area under the curve are discussed. Various
    other issues such as choice between parametric and non-parametric methods,
    biases that affect the performance of a diagnostic test, sample size for
    estimating the sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve, and
    details of commonly used softwares in ROC analysis are also presented.

    Many networks in nature, society and technology are characterized by a
    mesoscopic level of organization, with groups of nodes forming tightly
    connected units, called communities or modules, that are only weakly linked
    to each other. Uncovering this community structure is one of the most
    important problems in the ﬁeld of complex networks. Networks often show a
    hierarchical organization, with communities embedded within other
    communities; moreover, nodes can be shared between different communities.
    Here, we present the ﬁrst algorithm that ﬁnds both overlapping communities
    and the hierarchical structure. The method is based on the local
    optimization of a ﬁtness function. Community structure is revealed by peaks
    in the ﬁtness histogram. The resolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling
    different hierarchical levels of organization to be investigated. Tests on
    real and artiﬁcial networks give excellent results.

    The journal impact factor ( ) is, by far, the most discussed bibliometric
    indicator. Since its introduction over 40 years ago, it has had enormous
    effects on the scientific ecosystem: transforming the publishing industry,
    shaping hiring practices and the allocation of resources, and, as a result,
    reorienting the research activities and dissemination practices of scholars.
    Given both the ubiquity and impact of the indicator, the JIF has been widely
    dissected and debated by scholars of every disciplinary orientation. Drawing
    on the existing literature as well as original research, this chapter
    provides a brief history of the indicator and highlights well-known
    limitations—such as the asymmetry between the numerator and the denominator,
    differences across disciplines, the insufficient citation window, and the
    skewness of the underlying citation distributions. The inflation of the JIF
    and the weakening predictive power is discussed, as well as the adverse
    effects on the behaviors of individual actors and the research enterprise.
    Alternative journal-based indicators are described and the chapter concludes
    with a call for responsible application and a commentary on future
    developments in journal indicators.

    We point out ten steps that we think will go a long way in improving
    personality science. The first five steps focus on fostering consensus
    regarding (1) research goals, (2) terminology, (3) measurement practices,
    (4) data handling, and (5) the current state of theory and evidence. The
    other five steps focus on improving the credibility of empirical research,
    through (6) formal modelling, (7) mandatory pre-registration for
    confirmatory claims, (8) replication as a routine practice, (9) planning for
    informative studies (e.g., in terms of statistical power), and (10) making
    data, analysis scripts, and materials openly available. The current,
    quantitybased incentive structures in academia clearly stand in the way of
    implementing many of these practices, resulting in a research literature
    with sometimes questionable utility and/or integrity. As a solution, we
    propose a quality-based reward scheme that explicitly weights published
    research by its Good Science merits. Scientists need to be increasingly
    rewarded for doing good work, not just lots of work.

    Background The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate evidence
    about authorship issues and provide synthesis of research on authorship
    across all research fields. Methods We searched bibliographical databases to
    identify articles describing empirical quantitive or qualitative research
    from all scholarly fields on different aspects of authorship. Search was
    limited to original articles and reviews. Results The final sample consisted
    of 123 articles reporting results from 118 studies. Most studies came for
    biomedical and health research fields and social sciences. Study design was
    usually a survey (53%) or descriptive study (27%); only 2 studies used
    randomized design. We identified four 4 general themes common to all
    research disciplines: authorship perceptions, definitions and practices,
    defining order of authors on the byline, ethical and unethical authorship
    practices, and authorship issues related to student/non-research
    personnel-supervisor collaboration. For 14 survey studies, a meta-analysis
    showed a pooled weighted average of 29% (95% CI 24% to 35%) researchers
    reporting their own or others' experience with misuse of authorship.
    Authorship misuse was reported more often by researcher outside of the USA
    and UK: 55% (95% CI 45% to 64%) for 4 studies in France, South Africa, India
    and Bangladesh vs. 23% (95% CI 18% to 28%) in USA/UK or international
    journal settings. Interpretation High prevalence of authorship problems may
    have severe impact on the integrity of the research process, just as more
    serious forms of research misconduct. There is a need for more
    methodologically rigorous studies to understand the allocation of
    publication credit across research disciplines.

    For knowledge to benefit research and society, it must be trustworthy.
    Trustworthy research is robust, rigorous, and transparent at all stages of
    design, execution, and reporting. Assessment of researchers still rarely
    includes considerations related to trustworthiness, rigor, and transparency.
    We have developed the Hong Kong Principles (HKPs) as part of the 6th World
    Conference on Research Integrity with a specific focus on the need to drive
    research improvement through ensuring that researchers are explicitly
    recognized and rewarded for behaviors that strengthen research integrity. We
    present five principles: responsible research practices; transparent
    reporting; open science (open research); valuing a diversity of types of
    research; and recognizing all contributions to research and scholarly
    activity. For each principle, we provide a rationale for its inclusion and
    provide examples where these principles are already being adopted.

    Using computer databases of scientific papers in physics, biomedical
    research, and computer science, we have constructed networks of
    collaboration between scientists in each of these disciplines. In these
    networks two scientists are considered connected if they have coauthored one
    or more papers together. Here we study a variety of nonlocal statistics for
    these networks, such as typical distances between scientists through the
    network, and measures of centrality such as closeness and betweenness. We
    further argue that simple networks such as these cannot capture variation in
    the strength of collaborative ties and propose a measure of collaboration
    strength based on the number of papers coauthored by pairs of scientists,
    and the number of other scientists with whom they coauthored those papers.

    The structure of scientific collaboration networks is investigated. Two
    scientists are considered connected if they have authored a paper together
    and explicit networks of such connections are constructed by using data
    drawn from a number of databases, including MEDLINE (biomedical research),
    the Los Alamos e-Print Archive (physics), and NCSTRL (computer science). I
    show that these collaboration networks form “small worlds,” in which
    randomly chosen pairs of scientists are typically separated by only a short
    path of intermediate acquaintances. I further give results for mean and
    distribution of numbers of collaborators of authors, demonstrate the
    presence of clustering in the networks, and highlight a number of apparent
    differences in the patterns of collaboration between the fields studied.

    By using data from three bibliographic databases in biology, physics, and
    mathematics, respectively, networks are constructed in which the nodes are
    scientists, and two scientists are connected if they have coauthored a
    paper. We use these networks to answer a broad variety of questions about
    collaboration patterns, such as the numbers of papers authors write, how
    many people they write them with, what the typical distance between
    scientists is through the network, and how patterns of collaboration vary
    between subjects and over time. We also summarize a number of recent results
    by other authors on coauthorship patterns.

    In 2014, SAGE Publications retracted 60 articles authored by Taiwanese
    researchers due to suspected peer-review fraud. This scandal led to the
    resignation of the Minister of Education at the time since he coauthored
    several retracted works. Issues regarding the lack of transparent
    decision-making processes regarding authorship were further disclosed.
    Motivated by the scandal, we believe that this is one of the first empirical
    studies of questionable authorship practices (QAPs) in East Asian academia;
    we investigate Taiwanese researchers’ perceptions of QAPs. To meet this
    purpose, a self-reported survey was developed. Four hundred and three local
    researchers, including research faculty (e.g., professors), postdoctoral
    researchers, and Ph.D. students, participated in the survey. Four major
    findings resulted. First, the underlying causes of Taiwanese doctoral
    students’ engagement in QAPs were attributable to their desire to achieve
    particular academic-related successes and their feeling of reciprocal
    obligation to support other researchers. Second, the underlying motives for
    Taiwanese research associates’ (i.e., research faculty and postdoctoral
    fellows) engagement in QAPs were attributable to their attempts to achieve
    particular career successes and of the desire to consolidate their
    professional networks. Third, the participants generally agreed that QAPs
    had a long history among local academics but were rarely reported. Fourth,
    participants’ backgrounds (i.e., research discipline, academic rank, and
    type of affiliations) had significant effects on their responses regarding
    particular authorship issues; however, their gender did not have a
    significant effect. QAPs are a critical issue in Taiwanese academia;
    therefore, we discussed the implications of the current findings including
    subsequent instruction and future research.

    There currently exist hundreds of millions of scientific publications, with
    more being created at an ever-increasing rate. This is leading to
    information overload: the scale and complexity of this body of knowledge is
    increasing well beyond the capacity of any individual to make sense of it
    all, overwhelming traditional, manual methods of curation and synthesis. At
    the same time, the availability of this literature and surrounding metadata
    in structured, digital form, along with the proliferation of computing power
    and techniques to take advantage of large-scale and complex data, represents
    an opportunity to develop new tools and techniques to help people make
    connections, synthesize, and pose new hypotheses. This dissertation consists
    of several contributions of data, methods, and tools aimed at addressing
    information overload in science. My central contribution to this space is
    Autoreview, a framework for building and evaluating systems to automatically
    select relevant publications for literature reviews, starting from small
    sets of seed papers. These automated methods have the potential to help
    researchers save time and effort when keeping up with relevant literature,
    as well as surfacing papers that more manual methods may miss. I show that
    this approach can work to recommend relevant literature, and can also be
    used to systematically compare different features used in the
    recommendations. I also present the design, implementation, and evaluation
    of several visualization tools. One of these is an animated network
    visualization showing the influence of a scholar over time. Another is
    SciSight, an interactive system for recommending new authors and research by
    finding similarities along different dimensions. Additionally, I discuss the
    current state of available scholarly data sets; my work curating, linking,
    and building upon these data sets; and methods I developed to scale graph
    clustering techniques to very large networks.

    Context Convergent analyses in different disciplines support the use of the
    Percentage of Papers by the Most Prolific author (PPMP) as a red flag to
    identify journals that can be suspected of questionable editorial practices.
    We examined whether this index, complemented by the Gini index, could be
    useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using a large
    sample of biomedical journals.

    Methods We extracted metadata for all biomedical journals referenced in the
    National Library of Medicine, with any attributed Broad Subject Terms, and
    at least 50 authored (i.e. by at least one author) articles between 2015 and
    2019, identifying the most prolific author (i.e. the person who signed the
    most papers in each particular journal). We calculated the PPMP and the
    2015-2019 Gini index for the distribution of articles across authors. When
    the relevant information was reported, we also computed the median
    publication lag (time between submission and acceptance) for articles
    authored by any of the most prolific authors and that for articles not
    authored by prolific authors. For outlier journals, defined as a PPMP or
    Gini index above the 95th percentile of their respective distributions, a
    random sample of 100 journals was selected and described in relation to
    status on the editorial board for the most prolific author.

    Results 5 468 journals that published 4 986 335 papers between 2015 and 2019
    were analysed. The PPMP 95th percentile was 10.6% (median 2.9%). The Gini
    index 95th percentile was 0.355 (median 0.183). Correlation between the two
    indices was 0.35 (95CI 0.33 to 0.37). Information on publication lag was
    available for 2 743 journals. We found that 277 journals (10.2%) had a
    median time lag to publication for articles by the most prolific author(s)
    that was shorter than 3 weeks, versus 51 (1.9%) journals with articles not
    authored by prolific author(s). Among the random sample of outlier journals,
    98 provided information about their editorial board. Among these 98, the
    most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61%),
    among whom 25 (26% of the 98) were editors-in-chief.

    Discussion In most journals publications are distributed across a large
    number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few
    authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a
    disproportionate number of publications. The papers by these authors were
    more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their
    submission. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be
    transparent about their editorial and peer review practices.

    Logically, and by most common standards, academics would be pleased to be
    cited, considering it a form of recognition of their intellect. In return,
    especially those with high citation counts, such as Clarivate Analytics’
    Highly Cited Researchers, can benefit through peer recognition, rewards,
    funding, securing a better position, or expanding a collaborative network.
    Despite known and untold benefits, one issue has not been discussed: the
    right to refuse to be cited or the right to refuse a citation. Academics
    might not want to be cited by papers published in truly predatory journals,
    papers with false authors, or sting papers with falsified elements that
    employ underhanded ethical tactics. Currently, academics generally have the
    freedom to select where they publish their findings and choose studies they
    cite, so it is highly probable that requests to remove citations or refuse
    citations might never become formal publishing policy. Nonetheless, this
    academic discussion is worth having as valid and invalid literature
    increasingly gets mixed through citations, and as the grey zone between
    predatory/non-predatory and scholarly/unscholarly becomes increasingly
    difficult to distinguish.

    The changing world of scholarly communication and the emerging new wave of
    &lsquo;Open Science&rsquo; or &lsquo;Open Research&rsquo; has brought to
    light a number of controversial and hotly debated topics. Evidence-based
    rational debate is regularly drowned out by misinformed or exaggerated
    rhetoric, which does not benefit the evolving system of scholarly
    communication. This article aims to provide a baseline evidence framework
    for ten of the most contested topics, in order to help frame and move
    forward discussions, practices, and policies. We address issues around
    preprints and scooping, the practice of copyright transfer, the function of
    peer review, predatory publishers, and the legitimacy of
    &lsquo;global&rsquo; databases. These arguments and data will be a powerful
    tool against misinformation across wider academic research, policy and
    practice, and will inform changes within the rapidly evolving scholarly
    publishing system.

    The main drawback of ranking of researchers by the number of papers,
    citations or by the Hirsch index is ignoring the problem of distributing
    authorship among authors in multi-author publications. So far, the
    single-author or multi-author publications contribute to the publication
    record of a researcher equally. This full counting scheme is apparently
    unfair and causes unjust disproportions, in particular, if ranked
    researchers have distinctly different collaboration profiles. These
    disproportions are removed by less common fractional or authorship-weighted
    counting schemes, which can distribute the authorship credit more properly
    and suppress a tendency to unjustified inflation of co-authors. The urgent
    need of widely adopting a fair ranking scheme in practise is exemplified by
    analysing citation profiles of several highly-cited astronomers and
    astrophysicists. While the full counting scheme often leads to completely
    incorrect and misleading ranking, the fractional or authorship-weighted
    schemes are more accurate and applicable to ranking of researchers as well
    as research teams. In addition, they suppress differences in ranking among
    scientific disciplines. These more appropriate schemes should urgently be
    adopted by scientific publication databases as the Web of Science (Thomson
    Reuters) or the Scopus (Elsevier).

    Tenure, promotion, significant salary increases, let alone stature and
    recognition in one’s field, are often dependent on the quantity and quality
    of research articles faculty members produce. In addition, research grants,
    text and professional publications may be dependent upon intellectual
    contributions and often equated with research published in professional
    journals. These pressures, along with accreditation requirements, often
    force faculty members to place greater emphasis on research rather than
    teaching or service responsibilities. Administrators sometimes also coerce
    senior faculty members to “help out” junior faculty members achieve tenure
    by including them in their research endeavors. In response to such pressures
    more and more research articles have an increasing number of authors on the
    publication byline. This poses ethical concerns regarding author validity
    and legitimate individual contribution to research that helps to advance the
    profession.

    Objectives To assess the prevalence of honorary and ghost authors in six
    leading general medical journals in 2008 and compare this with the
    prevalence reported by authors of articles published in 1996.

    Design Cross sectional survey using a web based questionnaire.

    Setting International survey of journal authors.

    Participants Sample of corresponding authors of 896 research articles,
    review articles, and editorial/opinion articles published in six general
    medical journals with high impact factors in 2008: Annals of Internal
    Medicine, JAMA, Lancet, Nature Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine,
    and PLoS Medicine.

    Main outcome measures Self reported compliance with International Committee
    of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for all authors
    on the selected articles.

    Results A total of 630/896 (70.3%) corresponding authors responded to the
    survey. The prevalence of articles with honorary authorship or ghost
    authorship, or both, was 21.0% (95% CI 18.0% to 24.3%), a decrease from
    29.2% reported in 1996 (P=0.004). Based on 545 responses on honorary
    authorship, 96 articles (17.6% (95% CI 14.6% to 21.0%)) had honorary authors
    (range by journal 12.2% to 29.3%), a non-significant change from 1996
    (19.3%; P=0.439). Based on 622 responses on ghost authorship, 49 articles
    (7.9% (6.0% to 10.3%)) had ghost authors (range by journal 2.1% to 11.0%), a
    significant decline from 1996 (11.5%; P=0.023). The prevalence of honorary
    authorship was 25.0% in original research reports, 15.0% in reviews, and
    11.2% in editorials, whereas the prevalence of ghost authorship was 11.9% in
    research articles, 6.0% in reviews, and 5.3% in editorials.

    Conclusions Evidence of honorary and ghost authorship in 21% of articles
    published in major medical journals in 2008 suggests that increased efforts
    by scientific journals, individual authors, and academic institutions are
    essential to promote responsibility, accountability, and transparency in
    authorship, and to maintain integrity in scientific publication.

    Although citations are used as a quantifiable, objective metric of academic
    influence, cases have been documented whereby references were added to a
    paper solely to inflate the perceived influence of a body of research. This
    reference list manipulation (RLM) could take place during the peer-review
    process (e.g., coercive citation from editors or reviewers), or prior to it
    (e.g., a quid-pro-quo between authors). Surveys have estimated how many
    people may have been affected by coercive RLM at one time or another, but it
    is not known how many authors engage in RLM, nor to what degree. Examining a
    subset of active, highly published authors (n=20,803) in PubMed, we find the
    frequency of non-self citations (NSC) to one author coming from one paper
    approximates Zipf’s law. We propose the Gini Index as a simple means of
    quantifying skew in this distribution and test it against a series of “red
    flag” metrics that are expected to result from RLM attempts. We estimate
    between 81 (FDR <0.05) and 231 (FDR<0.10) authors are outliers on the curve,
    suggestive of chronic, repeated RLM. Based upon the distribution, we
    estimate approximately 3,284 (16%) of all authors may have engaged in RLM to
    some degree, possibly opportunistically. Finally, we find authors who use
    18% or more of their references for self-citation are significantly more
    likely to have NSC Gini distortions, suggesting their desire to see their
    work cited carries over into their peer-review activity.

    In this study, I developed operational versions of Gini&rsquo;s and
    Hirsch&rsquo;s indexes that can be applied to characterize each
    researcher&rsquo;s publication history (PH) as heterodox, orthodox, and
    interdisciplinary. In addition, the new indicators warn against anomalies
    that potentially arise from tactical or opportunistic citation and
    publication behaviors by authors and editors, and can be calculated from
    readily available information. I split the original Hirsch index into nested
    indexes to isolate networking activity, as well as to distinguish scientific
    production (number of articles) from scientific productivity (rate of
    production), and used nested Gini indexes to identify intentional and
    successful intertopical and interdisciplinary research. I applied the most
    popular standardizations (i.e., per author and per year), and used simple
    methodologies (i.e., least-squares linear and cubic fitting, whole-career
    vs. subperiods, two-dimensional graphs). I provide three representative
    numerical examples based on an orthodox multidisciplinary PH, a heterodox PH
    from the social sciences, and an orthodox unidisciplinary PH from the
    physical sciences. Two additional numerical examples based on PHs from the
    life and health sciences show that the suggested PH characterization can be
    applied to different disciplines where different publication and citation
    practices prevail. Software is provided to help readers explore the use of
    these indicators.

    This paper develops an empirically validated theoretical model of a
    researcher’s publication goal to assess which standardisations and policies
    are more likely to achieve equity and efficiency in different disciplines.
    The main theoretical insight is that there is a trade-off between equity and
    efficiency, as well as between networking activity and knowledge-diffusion
    activity. The main empirical insight is that, in order to achieve equity and
    efficiency, the original version of the H index should be replaced by a
    version that is standardised per author and per year and calculated by
    excluding reciprocal citations and publications other than peer-reviewed
    articles.
