# Introduction



Research integrity [ethical behaviour, sound methodology and rigorous peer review; @szomszor2020] provides assurance that scientific activities lead to trustable and replicable results. Research integrity is, however, under threat as a result of how science currently operates. The recent, unprecedented expansion of science, exemplified, for instance, by the  exponentially growing number of scientific articles [@fire2019], gives way to the wide-spread use of scientometry for assessing the productivity and impact of researchers [@aubertbonn2021]. As science is usually founded by public resources, the desire to measure the performance of its actors is well justified. Introducing the assessment of scientists by one or a few metrics, like number of publications or citations, together with the hyper-competitiveness of science had, however, somehow unexpected consequences [@biagioli2019].

As, among others, Charles Goodhart observed, if a metric is used as a target then it becomes a bad measure [@edwards2017; @fire2019]. This happens because people, in response to introduction of a target, alter their own behaviour to affect the measure directly instead to modify the activity the change of which was intended by introducing the metric [@werner2015]. In the recent process of corporatisation of science two such measures became relevant: the numbers of papers and citations [@grossman2019].

Goodhart's law is well illustrated by the introduction of the number of papers as measure of productivity in science. Using this measure is based on the assumption that characteristics of scientific papers (like length or number of coauthors) are fixed and hence targeting more papers automatically leads to the generation of more new knowledge. Unfortunately, this was not what had happened, scientists responded in some unexpected, but clearly rational and sometimes unethical, ways [@fong2017; @gopalakrishna2021]. For instance, they reduced the length of papers [@fire2019], i.e. they are publishing the same amount of knowledge in more papers (salami articles). Furthermore, mangling with authorship appeared where offering authorship to those who did not contributed to the given paper considerably (honorary authorship) can quickly increase their number of publications, again without any increase in knowledge produced [@aubertbonn2021; @biagioli2019; @fong2017; @gopalakrishna2021]. A possible sign of this questionable authorship practice can be the recent raise of number of authors per paper [@fire2019]. One may argue that more authors per paper is the sign of science becoming more interdisciplinary. A recent analysis is, however, unlikely to support this conclusion; the number of coauthors increases with time even after controlling for attributes related to complexity of science [@papatheodorou2008]. Another reason for the increased number of coauthors might be the increased efficiency that can follow from the increased possibility for division of labour facilitated by more authors [@demesnard2017]. In this case, however, it is expected that the number of papers per author also increases, which seems not to be the case [@fire2019].

Questionable authorship practice, on the other hand, appears to be common. Recent surveys suggest that about 30% of authors were involved in these unethical practices [@biagioli2019; @fong2017; @gopalakrishna2021; @grossman2019; @halaweh2020; @marusic2011]. One of them is ghost authorship when someone who has significantly contributed to the article is excluded from the author bylist [@jabbehdari2017]. In other forms (honorary authorship) just the opposite happens; those are offered authorship who have not (considerably) contributed to the work published [@fong2017; @gopalakrishna2021]. Several reasons can be behind gifting authorship to someone. Junior authors might include more senior ones because of respect or they are forced to do so [@pan2020]. Senior authors may gift authorship to juniors in order to help them obtain post-doctoral scholarships or tenure [@vonbergen2017].

A very efficient way to increase the number of publications is to practice honorary authorship reciprocally. The most organised form of this behaviour is founding publication cartels. The cartel is formed by a group of people who agree to mutually invite each others to their own publications as guest authors without any contribution. As in recent assessment practice coauthored papers count as a whole publication to every coauthor on the bylist, publication cartels can significantly boost the productivity of cartel members. This is the phenomenon which is called as 'publication club' by @demesnard2017. As the noun of 'club' involves a positive connotation we prefer to use 'cartel' for this under studied but highly unethical behaviour. Simple argument suggests that sharing the credit of a publication among the coauthors can decrease the incentive of forming cartels [@demesnard2017]. The simplest scenario for sharing is the 1/_n_ rule under which only 1/_n_ part of a publication is attributed to each of the _n_ coauthors of the given paper [@demesnard2017].

In this paper we develop a simple model of publication cartels to understand how effective they are to increase members' productivity and whether it is possible to eliminate them by applying different measures, like the 1/_n_ rule. We then extend our study to situations resembling more to real world conditions by developing a computer simulation of cartels. We also use this simulation to derive signals of cartel formation in publication networks and then search for these signals in two real publication networks.

<!--

Under current conditions a scientist' reputation is proportional to the number of papers he or she (co)authored. This puts a great pressure on scientists to increase their number of publications, a process nicely summarised by the term "publish or perish". An easy way to increase the number of publications is to form "!pubcarts" where authors cooperate to form a group and reciprocally invite each others to be coauthor on their papers.

-->

# The model

We compare the publication performance of two authors, author _A_ and author _B_. Authors work in separate groups (group _A_ and group _B_, respectively) each of which contains _G_~i~ (_i_ = _A_ or _B_) people (including the focal author). Each author in group _A_ produces _p_~A~ papers in a year by collaborating with _c_~A~ authors from outside of the group, i.e. their primary production is _p_~A~. Similarly, each author in group _B_ primarily produces _p_~B~ papers by collaborating with _c_~B~ people outside of the group. The difference between author _A_ and _B_ is that authors in group _A_ work independently of each other, while authors in group _B_ invite all other group members to be a coauthor on their papers independently of their contribution to that paper (Figure 1). In other words, authors in group _B_ form a !pubcart.

![!FIGURE(1) The publication relationships in group _A_ and _B_. Nodes are authors, while edges symbolise shared publications. Groups of four authors are marked by the underlying shapes. In group _A_ authors work with several coauthors from outside of the group but they do not invite group mates to be coauthors on their own papers. Contrarary, authors in group _B_ form a !pubcart i.e. each author invites all other aouthors in the group to be a coauthor (note the connections between group members).](paperfigs/groups.!EXT)

For simplicity, we assume that _p_~A~ = _p_~B~ = _p_, _G_~A~ = _G_~B~ = _G_ (_G_ > 1) and _c_~A~ = _c_~B~ = _c_, i.e. author groups are of the same size, authors produce the same number of primary papers and they have the same number of coauthors from outside of the group. In this case the total numbers of papers produced by the groups, the group productivity, are equal (_Gp_ = _G_~A~_p_~A~ and _G_~B~_p_~B~, respectively). The total numbers of papers (co)authored by author _A_ and _B_ are, however, different. Author _A_ writes _n_~A~ = _p_~A~ = _p_ papers. On the other hand, author _B_ (co)authors  _n_~B~ = _p_~B~ + (_G_~B~ - 1) _p_~B~ = _G_~B~ _p_~B~ = _Gp_ papers. In the case of author _B_ the term (_G_~B~ - 1)_p_~B~ represents the papers on which author _B_ is invited as honorary author. It is easy to see that as far as _G_ > 1, author _B_ will have more paper than author _A_, i.e _n_~B~ > _n_~A~. 

A natural way to correct for this bias is to taking into account the number of authors each paper has and instead of counting the papers themselves as a measure of productivity one sums the inverse of the number of authors [the 1/_n_ rule, demesnard2017; @vavrycuk2018]:

$$
w = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{1+C}.
$$

Here, number 1 in the denominator symbolises the focal author, while _C_ is the number of coauthors. For author _A_, _C_ = _c_~A~ = _c_. On the other hand, for author _B_, _C_ = (_G_~B~ - 1) + _c_~B~ = (_G_ - 1) + _c_. If _c_ = 0, then the division by the number of coauthors works, we regain the number of papers the authors produced without inviting their group members.

For author _A_:
$$
w_{A} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_A} \frac{1}{1} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_A} 1 = n_A = p.
$$

For author _B_:
$$
w_{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{n_B} \frac{1}{1+G-1} = \sum_{i=1}^{Gp} \frac{1}{G} = \frac{Gp}{G} = p.
$$

On the other hand, if the focal authors collaborate with others outside of their groups, as Figure 1 illustrates, the situation changes (Figure 2):

For author _A_:
$$
w_{A} = \sum_{i=1}^{p}\frac{1}{1+c} = \frac{p}{1+c}.
$$

For author _B_:
$$
w_{B} = \sum_{i=1}^{Gp}\frac{1}{G+c} = \frac{Gp}{G+c}.
$$

The weighted number of papers produced by author _B_ relative to author _A_, _w_~B~/_w_~A~, is:

$$
\frac{w_B}{w_A} = \frac{\frac{Gp}{G+c}}{\frac{p}{1+c}} = \frac{Gp}{G+c} \times \frac{1+c}{p} = \frac{G(1+c)}{G+c} = \frac{G+Gc}{G+c}.
$$

The proportion of _w_~B~/_w_~A~ is greater than one if _G_+_Gc_ > _G_+_c_, which is always true if _c_ > 0 (Figure 2). This means that if authors collaborate anyone from outside their groups then authors in group _B_ will always have higher publication performance than authors in group _A_, despite the fact that the two groups have the same productivity.

![!FIGURE(2) Publication performance when authors collaborate with people from outside of their groups. Weighted publication performance of author _A_ and _B_ (a). Weighted publication performance of author _B_ relative to that of author _A_ (b). The weighted publication performance is calculated by taking into account the number of coauthors. During this calculation first authorship can be rewarded by a bonus, _b_. If _b_ = 0, then each coauthors receive the same weight for a given publication. On the other hand, if _b_ > 0, the weight of the first author is higher then that of the coauthors, i.e. the first author of a paper is rewarded. On subpanel (a) _b_ = 0.2, on (b) _b_ is given on the right margin.](paperfigs/weighted_production.!EXT)

To compensate for this productivity bias, author _A_ should produce _w_~B~/_w_~A~ times more papers, _p_~A~ = _p_~B~(_G_ + _Gc_)/(_G_ + _c_). This surplus of papers needed for compensating the productivity bias increases with _c_ and it keeps to _G_.

Authors in group _A_ can also compensate for the productivity bias by decreasing the number of their collaborators from outside of the group. This reduction must be by a factor of _G_: _c_~A~ = _c_~B~ / _G_.

A useful modification to the 1/_n_ rule is the so called _first-author-emphasis_ scheme [@vavrycuk2018]. In this scheme, the first authors receive a bonus, _b_, to recognise their leading role in producing the papers. Under this scheme the weighted publication performance for author _A_, _w_~A~', is:

$$
w_{A}' = \sum_{i=1}^{n_A} \left(b + \frac{1-b}{1+c_A}\right) = \sum_{i=1}^{p}
\left(b + \frac{1-b}{1+c}\right) = \frac{p(1+bc)}{1+c}.
$$

Here, the first author, who is author _A_ for all his papers, get a bonus _b_ for contributing most to the paper, and the rest of the credit, 1-_b_, is divided equally between all authors (including the first one). The weighted publication performance for author _B_ under the first author scheme, _w_~B~', is:

$$
w_{B}' = \sum_{i=1}^{p_B} \left(b + \frac{1-b}{G_B + c_B}\right) + \sum_{i=1}^{(G_B - 1)p_B} \frac{1-b}{G_B + c_B},
$$

where the first term gives the credit for first author papers, while the second one is for the coauthored papers. After simplification, we obtain:

$$
w_{B}' = \frac{p(G+bc)}{G+c}.
$$

By comparing _w_~B~' to _w_~A~' it is easy to show that author _B_ will always have a higher publication performance than author _A_, i.e. _w_~B~'/_w_~A~' > 1, if _G_ > 1. Further analysis,

$$
\frac{w_{B}'}{w_{A}'} = \frac{p(G+bc)}{G+c} \times \frac{1+c}{p(1+bc)} = \frac{G+c[G+b(1+c)]}{G+c[1+b(G+c)]},
$$

shows that for _w_~B~'/_w_~A~' > 1, the condition _c_ > 0 should also be fulfilled. As numerical computation indicates (Figure 2) the bias is decreased by introducing the first authorship bonus, but it is still significant. @vavrycuk2018, for instance, recommend a bonus of _b_ = 0.2, but in this case author _B_ sill has around 50% more credit for the same work than author _A_ has. The difference between author _A_ and _B_ decreases as _b_ increases (Figure 2b), but this way coauthorship is worth less and less, undermining the benefits of collaborations.

To summarise, this simple model shows that the formation of !pubcarts can be an advantageous, but unethical, strategy in terms of increasing publication productivity even if one control for the number of coauthors of papers. Note, however, that this model might be overly simplified as all authors have the same primary productivity and we do not investigated how productivity of authors outside of the cartels changes as a consequence of founding cartels. To obtain a more realistic understanding of !pubcarts next we develop a simulation of the publication process.

# The simulation

&define MP _M_~P~
&define MC _M_~C~
&define GC _G_~C~

We start simulating the !pub process with constructing a !pubmat of papers and authors, !MP (Figure 3). Element _a_~ij~ of !MP is one if author _j_ is on the bylist of paper _i_ and zero otherwise. Therefore, !MP can be considered as a matrix representation of a bipartite graph, where rows and columns represent the two types of nodes, papers and authors, respectively. To construct !MP we set up _n_~C~ communities the sizes of which are given by _c_~l~ (_l_ = 1 ... _n_~C~), i.e. community _l_ consists of _c_~l~ authors. The number of papers written by author _j_ in community _l_ is given by _k_~l,j~. For each community we first construct an empty submatrix (all _a_~ij~ = 0) of size _p_~l~ and _c_~l~, where _p_~l~ > max(_k_~l,j~), for each community. Then for each columns _j_ we randomly distributed _k_~l,j~ number of ones over the _p_~l~ empty places. When we have constructed the submatrix for each community, we combine them along their diagonal to form the whole !pubmat by filling the appearing off-diagonal empty cells with zeros. Finaly, we randomly switch 10% of the ones with zeros such that the marginal sums of rows and columns do not change [@barabasi2016]. This degree maintaining rewiring connects the separate communities into a more-or-less connected graph. Having constructed !MP we create a weighted collaboration (or co-authorship) matrix, !MC, by projecting !MP to the nodes of authors. The weights of !MC, _w_~ij~, are Jaccard similarity indices  calculated between each pair of authors _i_ and _j_ (_i_ $\ne$ _j_) as

$$
w_{ij} = \frac{ | A_i \cap A_j | }{ | A_i \cup A_j | }.
$$

Here, _A_~i~ is the set of papers to which author _i_ contributed. In other words, the weight between two authors is the proportion of shared papers to the total number of unique papers to which either of authors _i_ or _j_ contributed to. It varies between zero (i.e. no common publication between author _i_ and _j_) and one (i.e. all publications by the two authors are shared). Note, Jaccard similarity between authors in group A of the above model is zero, while between authors in group B is one. From !MC we construct a !colgraph, !GC.

![!FIGURE(3) The construction of publication network. The top left panel shows the publication matrix, !MP. Each row and column of this matrix represents a paper and an author, respectively. Values of 1s indicate that an author is on the author list of a given paper, while dots symbolise zeros. From the publication matrix one can derive the collaboration matrix, !MC (bottom right panel) by calculating the Jaccard simmilarity (top right) for each possible pairs of authors. The bottom left panel shows the resulting weighted, undirected collaboration graph, !GC. The red squares exemplifies the calculation of Jaccar simmilarity.](paperfigs/sample_publication_network-01.!EXT)

We simulated the formation of cartels by randomly choosing $|\kappa|$ authors several times within a community (Figure 4). Let $\kappa$ is the set of cartel members. Then, with probability _p_~c~, we changed each element _a_~ij~ = 0 of !MP to _a_~ij~ = 1 where the following conditions met: _j_ $\in \kappa$ and at least one _a_~ik~ = 1 with _k_ $\in \kappa$ but _k_ $\ne$ _j_. We project the resulting !pubmat, !MP' to !MC' and constructed the corresponding !colgraph, !GC'.

![!FIGURE(4) The formation of cartels. The panels on the left illustrate a publication network without cartel. The panels on the right show how a cartel between authors A1, A4 and A6 can be formed: Author A6 invites authors A1 and A4 to be coauthors on paper p2, while author A1 do the same with authors A4 and A6 on paper p8. The small red rectangles mark the authorships gained this way. The bottom right panel shows the resulting collaboration graph, where the red edges connect cartel members. Note (i) the strong connections between members and (ii) adding cartels also changes the connections of non-members.](paperfigs/sample_publication_network-02.!EXT)

By setting all _k_~l,j~ = _k_ and _p_~l~ >> _k_ we can simulate the case of equal productivity and no collaboration from outside of the group. Here the simulation produces the same results as the model: productivity of cartel members increased but this can be accounted for by using weighted number of publications.

To induce collaboration between authors we next set _p_~l~ < $\sum$_k_ (the authors still have the same productivity prior to cartel formation). Under these conditions, if we consider the number of papers, the productivity of cartel members increases significantly by forming cartel while productivity of non-members does not change (Figure 5). In accordance with the model, the productivity of cartel members increases even if we consider the weighted number of papers. Interestingly, the productivity of many non-members decreases when cartel is formed (Figure 5).

![!FIGURE(5) The effect of cartel formation on the productivity of cartel members and non-members: equal prior productivity of authors. The top panels illustrate the collaboration graph before and after cartel formation. The middle panels show how the number of papers produced by members and non-members changes because of founding cartel. The bottom panels illustrate the same but using the weighted number of papers as a measure of productivity. Collaboration graph formed with _n_~C~ = 1, _c_~l~ = 30, _k_ = 3, _p_~l~ = 60, _p_~c~ = 1 and $\kappa =\{1,2,3,29,30\}$.](paperfigs/simulation_analyses-01.!EXT)

We further generalise the simulation results by setting the prior productivity of authors to different values (Figure 6). Using the number of papers leads to the same conclusions: members' productivity increases after cartel formation, non-members' productivity does not change. On the other hand, using the weighted number of papers reveal an interesting effect: the productivity of members with high prior productivity have their productivity being decreased because of cartel foundation (Figure 6). Similarly to the previous case, productivity of many non-members decreases as a consequence of cartel formation (Figure 6).

![!FIGURE(6) The effect of cartel formation on the productivity of cartel members and non-members: prior productivity of authors differs. The top panels illustrate the collaboration graph before and after cartel formation. The middle panels show how the number of papers produced by members and non-members changes because of founding cartel. The bottom panels illustrate the same but using the weighted number of papers as a measure of productivity. Collaboration graph formed with _n_~C~ = 1, _c_~l~ = 30, _k_~l,j~ = j, _p_~l~ = 60, _p_~c~ = 1 and $\kappa =\{1,2,3,29,30\}$.](paperfigs/simulation_analyses-02.!EXT)

The simulations strengthens the results of the model above, namely under real world conditions (i.e. productivity of authors differs, out-of-group collaborations) the number of papers as a measure of productivity cannot correct for the formation of cartels; members' productivity always increases by founding cartels. This effect, because of the great benefit in terms of productivity it offers, can put a huge pressure on scientists to establish cartels under the current circumstances found in the academic world, where most measures of productivity, e.g. citation counts, _h_-index, is based on the unweighted number of papers an author produces!TODO(we need a citation for this). Unfortunately, switching to the use of weighted number of papers does not solve the problems arising from the possibility of cartel formation, the productivity of members increases in most of the cases when they found cartels. Despite of this result, using weighted number of papers as metric can offer a significant opportunity to reduce unethical authorship practice, because cartel formation reduces the productivity of out-of-cartel collaborators, generating a conflict of interest between cartel members and non-members. This might lead to a situation when cartel members become isolated without the advantages of out-of-group collaborations and hence resulting a significant decrease in the benefits of cartel formation. The results of the simulation also suggest that, given that weighted number of papers used to rate authors, cartel members should be of similar prior productivity, because cartel establishment with lowly ranked authors can have a detrimental effect on the productivity of prolific authors. This would also introduce a conflict of interest between authors leading to that founding cartels is only worth for low productivity authors among themselves, because (i) highly ranked authors do not need to manipulate their productivity indices (they are already high) and (ii) they can actually loose on cartel formation, given that productivity is measured by weighted number of papers. As currently cartel formation cannot be penalised in science!TODO(we need a citation for this) we highly recommend to switch to use weighted number of papers as a basis of measuring productivity, because it introduces conflicts of interest that might drive the publication system towards self-purification.

# The prevalence of cartel formation

Given the significant benefit founding cartels provides, naturally arise the questions of (i) whether cartels can be identified in real !pubnets and (ii) how prevalent they are there. As cartels are !TCGs of authors we expect the increase of the frequency of strong connections in networks where cartels might operate. To investigate these possibilities we first perform simulation studies to identify possible signs of cartel formation then investigates real !pubnets for these signs.

## Footprints of cartels

We use the procedure outlined above to simulate !pubnets with the following differences: Now we simulate many communities and many more authors. The community sizes, _c_~l~, are drawn from a saturated power-law distribution with $\gamma$ = 2.5 and saturation point of _k_~sat~ = 10 [@barabasi2016]. The primary productivity of authors, _k_~l,j~, follows a saturated power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff with parameters $\gamma$ = 2.5, _k_~sat~ = 10 and _k_~cut~ = 450 [@barabasi2016]. The number of potential papers in community _l_, _p_~l~, is given as _p_~l~ = _Dc_~l~ where _D_ is a parameter of the simulation, initially set to _D_ = 6. Large _D_ implies less collaboration between authors. After the combination of the simulated communities we apply a degree-preserving randomisation [@barabasi2016] to rewire 10% of the links between authors and papers and hence connecting the communities together. We refer these networks as "no-cartels" networks hereafter. After generating the no-cartels networks we forms cartels in each community to create "cartels-added" networks. The size of these cartels follows a power-law distribution ($\gamma$ = 2.5) truncated at 20. We added one to these values to avoid single person cartels. When forming cartels the probability of changing an element of the !pubmat, _p_~c~ (see above), was drawn from a Beta distribution with parameters $\alpha$ (initially $\alpha = 6$) and $\beta = 1$. Around 0.1% of the authors in each community take part in the cartels. Finally, by using a degree maintaining rewiring procedure [@barabasi2016], we created randomised versions of the cartels-added !pubnets ("rewired" networks hereafter) to investigate the resilience of cartels to randomisation. After producing these !pubnets we removed authors with three or less papers to reduce the risk of accidentally forming strong ties between authors just because of the scarcity of their papers. Then the !pubnets were collapsed to create !colnets and finally !colgraphs. We compared the characteristics of these !colgraphs to identify possible signs of !pubcarts.

As we know the identity of cartel members in the cartels-added networks we tested the efficiency of two approaches to identify cartel members. In one of our approaches we followed the procedure of @wachs2019. These authors argue that cartels should be groups with high values of topological features of _coherence_ and _exclusivity_ [for further details, see @wachs2019]. Accordingly, we used the community detection algorithm of @wachs2019, calculate coherence and exclusivity, and delineate cartels on the basis of their high coherence and exclusivity values [@wachs2019]. Our second approach is based on the weights of links among authors. We simply deleted all links of the !colgraph with weight lower than a preset cut-off and retained the connected components of the graph as possible cartels. After delineating the possible cartels we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to investigate the performance of these two cartel finding approaches [@fawcett2006; @kumar2011]: we calculated true and false positive rates and F-measures [@fawcett2006].

The degree distributions of the !colgraphs are not affected by cartel formation (not shown). Foundation of cartels, however, increases the proportion of nodes with high strength (the sum of weights of the node's links in the !colgraphs, Figure 7). More interestingly, the frequency of links with high weights also increases when cartels founded. Remarkably, this results in many links with maximum weights which might be a characteristic sign of cartel formation (Figure 7). The random rewiring of cartels-added !pubnets destroyed these signs indicating that formation of !TCGs cannot be the results of random processes (Figure 7).

![!FIGURE(7) The effects of founding cartels. The panels show the distribution of node strengthes (top) and link weights (bottom). Magenta lines show the empirical complementary cummulative distribution functions (eCCDF) for ten independent simulations of no-cartels networks (dashed lines) and the combination of these runs (solid lines). Green lines illustrate the same for publication networks where cartels added (for details see main text). Orange lines show networks obtained by randomly rewiring publication networks with cartels added.](paperfigs/cartel_footprint-01.!EXT)

Our simulations support @wachs2019 results, namely cartels have high coherence and exclusivity (Figure 8). Nevertheless, the procedure of @wachs2019 was rather inefficient to identify cartel members (Figure 8). This inefficiency can be traced back to that the communities identified by their algorithm contain not just cartel members but many non members too. The simple rule using a cut-off on link weights, however, performed surprisingly well (Figure 8). The simulations suggests that a cut-off value between 0.4-0.5 efficiently identifies cartel members (Figure 8). The efficiency of this rule is insensitive for the density of the !pubnets, (parameter _D_, see above and the Appendix) and the probability distribution of adding connections between cartel members (parameter $\alpha$, the Appendix).

On the left, the distribution of communities from a randomly rewired network is shown, while on the right the distribution for a cartels-added !pubnet is given. The cartels on the right are plotted as red dots in the state space. Note, in the cartels-added network the frequency of communities with high coherence and exclusivity increased (the zone bordered by the white dashed line). The two bottom panels show the performance characteristics of two algorithms used to identify authors participating in cartels. The performance is characterised by receiver operating characteristics [ROC, @fawcett2006]. The left panel depicts the characteristics for the algorithm proposed by @wachs2019 to identify binding cartels, while the right one pictures the characteristics of a simple cut-off rule based on link weights.

## Tightly connected groups in real networks

### Data on real !pubnets

We used two publication databases to obtain data about real !pubnets. One is the Hungarian Scientific Bibliography (www.mtmt.hu, MTMT hereafter) operated by the Library and Information Centre of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (www.konyvtar.mta.hu). The MTMT is a curated database of publications by researchers in Hungary. As it is used by grant agencies in Hungary, each of its records checked by its staff which process ensures a trusted publication database. An important feature of MTMT is that all of the authors have a unique identification number allowing the reliable identification of authors and hence easing the construction of !pubnets. Data were collected in December 2019. We downloaded the complete publication lists of 31,498 authors from www.mtmt.hu. During data procession we retained only those articles which were published in journals with a journal ranking. This resulted in 23,508 authors and 141,634 papers, i.e. a !pubmat of 141,634 rows and 23,508 columns. From this !pubmat we first removed authors with three or less papers and then constructed a !colmat using the Jacard similarity index as above. At the end we have a !colgraph with 15,244 authors as nodes.

The other source of data we used is the 'dblp computer science bibliography' (dblp.org). It contains more than 5 millions records about papers published in  all fields of computer science mainly in English. This database is also curated, and the maintainers spend a lot of resources to disambiguate homonymous authors [@kim2018]. Data from dblp were collected in December 2019. We downloaded the full dblp database and then retained only those records which had a doi entry [@fire2019]. This resulted in 1,584,799 articles from 1,224,481 authors. Authors with less than four papers were removed from these dataset too, leading to a !colgraph with 259,333 authors as nodes. A quantitative description of these networks is given in the Appendix.

### Tightly connected groups

Characteristics of real !pubnets indicate the presence of !TCGs in these networks (Figure 9). In both real networks the frequency of links with high weights are much higher than expected by chance, similarly to the simulated cartels-added networks. The distributions of strengths also indicate the presence of strongly connected groups. Using a conservative cut-off value of 0.5 we identified 1,068 (7.0%) and 21,972 (8.5%) authors in 465 and 9,729 !TCGs in the MTMT and dblp networks, respectively. In the MTMT !pubnet we were able to identify subnets of authors based on the subject of the journals, they published in. These subnetworks also show the sign of !TCGs (see Appendix). In other words, the formation of !TCGs is not characteristics of just a few scientific subject groups.

The panels show the empirical complementary cummulative distribution function (eCCDF) of node strengths (top) and link weights (bottom) for two real publication networks: MTMT (left) and dblp (right). The blue lines show the distributions for the real networks, while the orange lines give the distributions for twenty randomly rewired networks.](paperfigs/real_networks.!EXT)

Most of the !TCGs were small, but groups of ten or more individuals also occurred (Figure 10).

One of the major advantage of forming collaboration groups is thought to be the higher productivity these groups can achieve. To investigate this possibility we randomly formed groups from those authors who were not members of any !TCG. For each distinct size value of !TCGs we generated 30,000 random groups and calculated productivity measures for them. Surprisingly, the productivity of !TCGs, both in the MTMT and the dblp databases, was generally lower than that of similar sized groups formed randomly within these datasets. This result holds irrespectively of the measure used to characterise productivity (Figure 11). Nevertheless, forming !TCGs seems to be effective to increase the number of papers an author publishes. Of the !TCGs found in 8.8% (MTMT) and 15.8% (dblp) had their authors published significantly lower number of papers then authors in randomly formed groups. Contrary, in the case of average group productivity (i.e. number of distinct papers the group produced divided by group size) authors had significantly lower productivity in 34.0% (MTMT) and 62.7% (dblp) of !TCGs than authors in random groups of similar size.

![!FIGURE(11) The productivity of !TCGs compared to similarly sized random groups. Left panels show the distributions of different productivity measures for the MTMT dataset, while right panels show the same for the dblp dataset. Tightly connected groups (tight groups in the legends) are authors connected by links with weights of 0.5 or more. Random groups were formed by choosing authors randomly from the pools of authors not involved in !TCGs. The size of the random groups follows the size of the !TCGs. Medians (M) of the measures for the two types of groups are given in figure legends.](paperfigs/group_productivity.!EXT)

According to the calculations in the Appendix, authors in !TCGs share in average 63.3% (MTMT) and 67.3% (dblp) of their papers among their group mates. In many groups (MTMT: 15.7%, dblp: 22.6%), however, authors share even more than 80% of their papers (Figure 13).

# General discussion



- results
    - model
    - simulation
    - real networks

- 

- long period of data
  -  short cartels cannot be detected because earlier/later independent publication activity dilute cartel activity
  - early career researchers are more exposed; they have fewer papers, it is easier to produce strong strength between authors
